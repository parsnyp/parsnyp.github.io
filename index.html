<h1>Hello Other Pet Owners</h1>

<p>Did you know that your pets are objectively <span class = "underline red">worse</span> than mine?</p>

<p>I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but its true.</p>

<h2 style = "bold">Reasoning</h2>

<h3>Why are my pets better than yours</h3>


<ol>
  <li>They are very cool and good</li>
  <li>I like them a lot</li>
  <li>Their owner is pretty cool</li>
</ol>

<p> </p>
<p><br>Additionally...</p>

<h3>Why your pets are worse than mine</h3>

<ol>
  <li>They aren't cool and good</li>
  <li>I don't like them a lot</li>
  <li>Your pets aren't my pets, so I don't like them as much</li>
</ol>
